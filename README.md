This project is created for ENGG1330 Group Project (A text-based game).

## IMPORTANT: 
  The game can only run on UNIX-based terminal because our code is based on a built-in module 'curses'. This module is only used for UNIX terminal.

## Start Playing

To start the game, run the main.py file using command "python3 main.py" ('' ''not included).

The player needs to control a plane, fire bullets and try to avoid or destroy obstacles.
Each obstacle has 2 HP and 1 bullet will make 1 HP damage, which means we need 2 bullets to destroy 1 obstacle completely. 
After every 30s, the traveling speed of obstacles will increase, but other factors remain constant. 
When an obstacle crashes into your plane, game over.
